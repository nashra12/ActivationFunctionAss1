    "Q1. What is an activation function in the context of artificial neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-> An activation function in artificial neural networks determines the output of a neuron, transforming its input into a meaningful output. It introduces non-linearity, enabling neural networks to model complex relationships in data. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax. Sigmoid and tanh squash inputs into a specific range, suitable for binary or bounded output tasks. ReLU, preferred for hidden layers, outputs zero for negative inputs, speeding up convergence in training. Softmax is used in multi-class classification to output probabilities summing to one. Choosing the right activation function impacts network performance and learning efficiency\n",

    "Q3. How do activation functions affect the training process and performance of a neural network?\n",
    "Ans-> Activation functions significantly impact neural network training and performance. They introduce non-linearity, enabling networks to model complex relationships in data. Well-chosen functions can accelerate convergence by ensuring gradients propagate effectively during backpropagation. Poor choices, like saturated functions (e.g., sigmoid with vanishing gradients), can lead to slow learning or gradient explosion. Functions like ReLU address these issues, promoting faster training through sparsity and avoiding vanishing gradient problems. The selection of activation functions thus crucially affects both the efficiency of learning and the accuracy of the network's predictions.\n",

    "Q4. How does the sigmoid activation function work? What are its advantages and disadvantages?\n",
    "Ans-> The sigmoid activation function transforms input values into a range between 0 and 1, suitable for binary classification tasks. It smoothly squashes input values, facilitating the interpretation of outputs as probabilities. Advantages include clear interpretation as probabilities and smooth derivatives, which aid in gradient-based optimization. However, sigmoid functions can suffer from vanishing gradient issues when inputs are very large or very small, slowing down training. Additionally, outputs are not zero-centered, which may hinder convergence in certain scenarios. Despite these drawbacks, sigmoid functions remain useful in output layers for binary classification tasks where outputs need to be interpreted as probabilities.\n",

    "Q5.What is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function? How does it differ from the sigmoid function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans->The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function outputs zero for negative inputs and linearly passes positive inputs as-is. Unlike the sigmoid function, which squashes inputs to a range between 0 and 1, ReLU introduces sparsity and accelerates training by avoiding vanishing gradient problems associated with saturated activations. ReLU's simplicity and efficiency make it widely favored for hidden layers in neural networks, promoting faster convergence and better handling of large-scale datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are the benefits of using the ReLU activation function over the sigmoid function?\n",
    "Ans-> Using the ReLU activation function over sigmoid offers several benefits. ReLU accelerates training by avoiding the vanishing gradient problem that sigmoid faces with very large or very small inputs. Its linear nature promotes sparse activation, improving computational efficiency in deep networks. This function also allows networks to learn faster and perform better on large datasets, making it well-suited for complex tasks where deep architectures are necessary. Overall, ReLU's advantages lie in faster convergence, reduced computational load, and improved ability to learn complex patterns in data\n",

    "Q7. Explain the concept of \"leaky ReLU\" and how it addresses the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-> Leaky ReLU is an extension of the ReLU activation function that allows a small, non-zero gradient when the input is negative. Typically defined as f(x)=max⁡(ax,x) where aa is a small positive constant, Leaky ReLU prevents neurons from dying out (where gradients become zero), which addresses the vanishing gradient problem. This ensures that even during backpropagation, neurons with negative inputs continue to receive a small gradient, enhancing the robustness and training stability of deep neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the purpose of the softmax activation function? When is it commonly used?\n",
    "Ans-> The softmax activation function converts raw scores into probabilities that sum to one, making it ideal for multi-class classification tasks. It is commonly used in the output layer of neural networks to provide a probability distribution over multiple classes, facilitating decision-making based on the highest probability class.\n",
